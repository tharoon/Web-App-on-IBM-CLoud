# Web-App-on-IBM-Cloud

### Deployed a simple web application on IBM Cloud using Python flask framework

This project was my first step in exploring the different aspects of cloud computing. 


I developed a web aplication with simple UI using HTML5 and developed backend using the Python Framework. 
The backend for this application does not involve complex processing. It just accepts the request from the frontend, 
do a minimal operation by fetching the data from the database and render them back to the UI.

In the IBM cloud, I configured the database that is required for my application and loaded some data from the csv file. I then deployed my python application into the IBM cloud
and had some hands on how the cloud architecture worked, what are the different configurations of the cloud and the difficulties in hosting the application.

### This was my very first project in the cloud environment and I really had a great learning experience.
